These are places where discussions can happen and where you can share suggestions for how the WLAN Pi should be improved and discuss those improvements with the community, including members of the WLAN Pi team. Check out [Making suggestions](#making-suggestions) to learn how to provide feedback.

Accordingly, the Issues feature of this repository has been disabled. Discussion categories have been established for specific features listed above, as well as a general category for other topics. 

# Making suggestions

We encourage you to [open a discussion](https://github.com/wlan-pi/feedback/discussions) if you have suggestions for how we can improve WLAN Pi. You don't need to have a solution to the problem you are facing to kick off a discussion. We are hoping to foster productive and collaborative conversations, so please check out [how to give good feedback](https://github.com/WLAN-Pi/feedback/discussions/2) if you want some guidance on how to kick off a successful discussion.

Prior to making a new discussion, please take a look through previous discussions to see if someone else has already brought to our attention your suggestions. If you find a similar discussion, reply with additional details or upvote the discussion to signal your support rather than creating a new discussion. We are more likely to work on discussions that bring value to multiple folks. Also please review the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before participating in discussions.
