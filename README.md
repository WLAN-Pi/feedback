These are places where discussions can happen and where you can share suggestions for how the WLAN Pi should be improved and discuss those improvements with the community, including members of the WLAN Pi team. Check out [Making suggestions](#making-suggestions) to learn how to provide feedback.

Accordingly, the Issues feature of this repository has been disabled. Discussion categories have been established for specific features listed above, as well as a general category for other topics. 

# Making suggestions

We encourage you to open a discussion if you have suggestions for how we can improve our products. You don't need to have a solution to the problem you are facing to kick off a discussion. We are hoping to foster productive and collaborative conversations, so please check out how to give good feedback if you want some guidance on how to kick off a successful discussion. Please review the [CODE OF CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before participating in discussions.
